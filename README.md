Very Basic website with a front and backend.

Front end just written using HTML/CSS/JS in a single file. Frontend calls API's written in proiq.py
Backend written using FastAPI, hosted on AWS. I already reused the Magnate FastAPI app infrastructure, so won't include that code here. I added an extra set of endpoints just to work with proiq in the proiq.py file.
